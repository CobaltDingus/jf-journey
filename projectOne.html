            <h1>Laying the Foundations</h1>
            <p>
                Our first project was to build a functioning game of Tic-Tac-Toe in the browser. 
                All we had at this point was basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                Although I had done some coding before SEB71, I still felt quite inexperienced, especially with JavaScript which,
                funnily enough, was going to be the main focus.
            </p>
            <p>
                I knew roughly at this point what each language did: HTML made up the actual page that was going to be displayed,
                CSS was for styling all the HTML elements, and JavaScript could... do things? 
            </p>
            <p>Eh, good enough to start the project.</p>

            <p>
                Alright so maybe it wasn't that bad. I understood that JavaScript could be used to make and run functions which, yeah, basically just do things.
                Still, it took me a while to decide how to begin. Eventually, I figured that if I wanted to play Tic-Tac-Toe, I had to go and draw the grid first so that was what I started with.

                    This may be the only time my HTML is short enough to explain in full: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>The <code>header</code> is for my Tic-Tac-Toe title,</li>
                        <li>the whole grid and sideboards are wrapped together by a <code>div</code> with the class <code>game-wrapper</code>,</li>
                        <li>my grid is just 9 <code>divs</code> inside a board <code>div</code>,</li>
                        <li>the scoreboards are just two <code>asides</code> before and after the board,</li>
                        <li>3 <code>buttons</code> for the, well, buttons</li>
                        <li>and a <code>h3</code> for my game message and a <code>p</code> for my trivia paragraph</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>The only odd thing out is the <code>bg-image div</code> at the very top. That's definitely a leftover from an unused idea
                that I'll go into later. Seems quite straightforward but mind you, this is just the HTML without the styling. Witness it in all it's natural glory below...

                  <p>
                    So to begin with, the two sideboards are arranged in a 3 column grid with the actual board grid. 
                    Then the board grid itself is also a 3 columnn grid, each column having 3 tile <code>divs</code>. 
                    The tiles were also given some height and width. 
                    Otherwise, they wouldn't make any shape, which is the reason why the pure HTML has nothing resembling a Tic-Tac-Toe board.
                    <p>
                        Lastly, and probably most interesting, is the <code>overflow: hidden</code> in the board styling. 
                        This is what's getting rid of all the outer borders of the board, leaving it looking like a hash tag.
                        The way this works - but don't quote me on this - is because the borders flow outside the <code>div</code> by nature of being borders, meaning they get hidden.
                        Whatever it is, it's not something I would have worked out without looking it up.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Regardless, I think it all looks much better now...

            <p>
                This is just a snippet of my surprisingly verbose code but it's where almost all the game logic is. 
                Anything relevant to the state of the game, like player scores and who's turn it is, are all kept track of in variables.
                From here, it's just assigning functions to elements that need to do things when clicked.
                The key methods for this were <code>document.querySelector</code> and the similar <code>document.querySelectorAll</code>.
                This allowed me to select certain elements like the empty tiles on the grid, which was stored as an array under <code>tileArray</code>. 
                With all the tiles selected, I could then let them detect if they were clicked through the <code>addEventListener</code> method.
            </p>

            <p>
                At this point, if any of the tiles were clicked, the clicked tile would run the assigned function <code>playerMove()</code>.
            This function takes the tile itself as its target and checks its class. If it is empty, it checks to see which player's turn it is and then
            changes the tile's class to the current player's symbol, filling it with an X or O.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you notice, I am also checking whether a player has won with every single move they make through the <code>checkVictory()</code> function.
                However, it only goes through with the rest of its code if the minimum number of moves for a victory have been made to save computing power.
                The way I actually check for a victory is through 3 functions which each scan every possible winning row, column, or diagonal:

                There might be better ways to check for a victory, and yeah most of my classmates had different methods, but it does work for my purposes. 
                Of course, if any of these functions return a true result (i.e. there's a three-in-a-row somewhere) then the round concludes and the winning player's score is incremented.
                If the players want to continue, then there are buttons for a new round or a whole new game, both of which simply set things back to the way they were.
                That's really all there is to the code for Tic-Tac-Toe: letting elements 'listen' for clicks and then doing stuff to change things.

                <p>
                    Remember how I had that leftover <code>bg-image div</code>? The reason why it was there was because I wanted to go for a 'history' theme.
                    The background would change depending on how the game was going (e.g. going from Ancient Egypt to Ancient Rome as the board filled up).
                    Everyone else was doing Tic-Tac-Toe too so everyone figured that they needed to do something unique and this was my idea. 
                    Unfortunately, I couldn't figure out how to make the game UI fit nicely with the wildly different backgrounds and also I did not have the time or willpower
                    to do something like this for my first project, especially one that wasn't graded on aesthetics.
                </p>
                <p>Instead, I made a compromise and included a trivia button. All it does it cycle through an array of Tic-Tac-Toe trivia
                    that I picked up from Wikipedia and displays it on the web page. I only wish I could have made it cooler somehow.
