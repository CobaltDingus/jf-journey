                <h1>Laying the Foundations</h1>
                <p>For this project, I decided to make something related to games. After some thinking, GameShare was brought into existence: a website where people could share what games they played and find other people who share their interests. Kinda like a gaming rip-off of Tinder.</p>
                <p>With my idea set in stone, I now had to make a database for all the information I needed to store. PostgreSQL was the tool that we were given for this purpose. It’s a relational database management system. In short, it means we just stuff all our data into tables with columns of attributes and rows and rows of data all following the same structure.</p>
                <p>For my app, I decided that I needed 3 tables:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>users:</strong> for user information,</li>
                    <li><strong>games:</strong> for game information,</li>
                    <li>and <strong>usergamelist:</strong> for each user's list of games</li>
                </ul>
                <pre class="theme-atom-one-dark"><code class="hljs-code language-sql">
                    CREATE TABLE users (
                        id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
                        username TEXT NOT NULL,
                        email TEXT NOT NULL,
                        password_hashed TEXT NOT NULL,
                        profile_image TEXT,
                        about_me TEXT
                    );
                    
                    CREATE TABLE games (
                        id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
                        title TEXT NOT NULL,
                        description TEXT,
                        image_url TEXT,
                        player_count INTEGER
                    );
                    
                    CREATE TABLE usergamelist (
                        id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
                        user_id INTEGER,
                        game_id INTEGER,
                        remark TEXT,
                        FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users (id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
                        FOREIGN KEY (game_id) REFERENCES games (id) ON DELETE CASCADE
                    );
                    </code></pre>
                <span class="subtitle">FOREIGN KEY indicates that the key is derived from a key in another table. If said key is deleted, then anything referencing it will get deleted too.</span>

                <p>
                    
                    Obviously, we weren’t just going to make a database that just stores users and nothing else. Being a gamer, I decided to make my website about games. Users would be able to show off a list of their favourite games to compare with other users and hopefully get in contact with people who share their interest. This meant I had to make two tables: one for all the different games and another to show the games for each user.
                    
                    Pretty much the same thing here except for the foreign keys. These are meant to represent the keys of another table, which helps to make sure the data is valid and also helps for joining the tables later when I need all the data in one spot. Like with the users, I also seeded these two tables with dummy data to simulate having people who care about my site enough to use it.

                <h1>Design ideas</h1>
                <p>
                    Given that we were all doing Tic-Tac-Toe, I had to try and put a unique spin on my website. For my spin, I decided to try doing a ‘history’ theme to explore the long history of the game itself. Initially, I wanted to have different backgrounds, each representing a period of time over the centuries of Tic-Tac-Toe’s existence. However, I quickly ran into a problem with this approach: the design of my board would conflict with the background, being too bright or too dark and just being hard to see in general. With most of my time spent on making the game work in the first place, I switched gears and tried to do an ‘arts and crafts’ theme. I picked a font that looked handwritten, a background colour that looked like brown paper, and simple monochromatic colors for the buttons. Luckily, I still kept some of my original ideas in the Trivia section which just spews out historical trivia about Tic-Tac-Toe.
