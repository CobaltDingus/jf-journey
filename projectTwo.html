            <h1>Laying the Foundations</h1>
            <p>
              For this project, we had to make a CRUD app, which stands for
              <strong>CREATE-READ-UPDATE-DESTROY</strong>, referring to the
              actions you can take with a database. In short, this meant making
              a website that gave users the ability to do all four actions to
              the data in a connected database. Being a <em>gamer</em>, I
              decided to make something related to games. After some thinking,
              <strong style="color: green">GameShare&trade;</strong> was brought
              into existence: a website where people could share what games they
              played and find other people who share their interests. Kinda like
              a gaming rip-off of Tinder<sup>&reg;</sup>.
            </p>
            <p>
              With my idea set in stone, I now had to make a database for all
              the information I needed to store. PostgreSQL was the tool that we
              were given for this purpose. It’s a relational database management
              system, which just means we just stuff all our data into tables
              with columns of attributes and rows and rows of data all following
              the same structure.
            </p>
            <p>For my app, I decided that I needed 3 tables:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>users:</strong> for user information,</li>
              <li><strong>games:</strong> for game information,</li>
              <li>
                and <strong>usergamelist:</strong> for each user's list of games
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              With the database ready, I now had to seed it with dummy data.
              Using JavaScript, I connected to the database and made a request
              to add new data to it. This is an example of the C(reating) part
              of CRUD.

                -> The way it works is by first generating
                <em style="color: aquamarine">salt</em>, a string of random
                numbers that will be attached to your password. The
                <em style="color: aquamarine">salted password</em> is then run
                through a hashing algorithm to turn it into an abomination of
                random characters that I will have to spend years trying to
                reverse engineer.

                -> This <em style="color: blue">hashed password</em> is what is
                sent to the database along with the user's name and email. The
                trick then is that a password passed through all the same
                <strong style="color: red">bcrypt</strong> functions will always
                return the same <em style="color: blue">hashed password</em>.
                This is how your plain text password is checked upon logging
                into the website.

              ...alright, I'm back. My service provider said they had to cut me
              off because I didn't pay my bill or something? Anyway, back to
              coding. In the pile of code above, there were 3 steps to
              communicating with PostgreSQL:
            </p>

            <pre class="theme-atom-one-dark"><code class="hljs-code language-javascript">
                        const db = require('./index.js')
                        
                        const sql = `INSERT INTO users (username, email, password_hashed) VALUES ($1, $2, $3);`
                    
                        db.query(sql, [name, email, hash], (err, result) => {
                            if (err) console.log(err);
                        })
                    </code></pre>
            <p>
              1. Connecting to the database. The index file contained all the
              necessary code to import the database as an object to execute
              functions.
            </p>
            <p>
              2. Coming up with instructions. SQL statements are, by design,
              meant to be somewhat understandable to non-coders. This one
              basically says "I want to insert some data in the users table,
              under these three columns, using three specific values for each
              respectively (marked as placeholders for now)."
            </p>
            <p>
              3. Making the actual query. Using the <code>.query</code> method
              on the <code>db</code> variable, the <code>sql</code> statement is
              sent the database, along with all the other info that's meant to
              fill in the placeholders (i.e. the user's name, email, and hashed
              password that was acquired earlier).
            </p>
            <div>-</div>
            <p>
              I then repeated this process with a loop to seed dummy data for 10
              users to simulate people caring about and using my
              website. With all the backend set up, I was ready to start with the
              actual website.

            For the website’s features, I started with the essential before considering anything else. These would be the features that carried out the necessary CRUD actions as per our objective. 
            To do anything with my database however, I needed 2 new tools we had picked up: <strong>Express and EJS (and Express-EJS-Layouts to integrate them)</strong>.

                        const game = result.rows[0]
                        const sqlGameUsers = `
                            SELECT * 
                            FROM usergamelist

                        })
                    })
                })
            </code></pre>
            <p>
                <strong>Express</strong> handled all the server side stuff like routing.
                Requests from the client would go through here if they visited any URL with a pattern like <code>gameshare.com/games/:id</code>.
                The ":id" in this case could be any anything. Whatever it is, it would be taken and put into an SQL statement to see if a game of that ID existed already in the database and if so, retrieve whatever data is being asked for.
                As you might see, I actually have two statements: one to get the game details and one to get a list of the users who play said game.
                Only after all this data is retrieved does the router render a web page for the user and for that, we now turn to <strong>EJS</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>EJS</strong> essentially allows you to run JavaScript inside a HTML file. That alone is nice but with <strong>Express-EJS-Layouts</strong>, you can make templates for web pages filled with dynamically generated content.

            <p>This is the base layout for every page in GameShare meaning that it applies for every page no matter what content the page actually has.
                You can see this base layout also includes a header (which is a custom layout for just the header of the page) and a content body which depends on what page layout I want to render. This for example is all I need to write for each game page:

                All the <code><% %></code>, or the 'crab hands' as we called them in class, signify embedded JavaScript (which is what EJS stands for). 
                The code creates and fills new HTML elements with data from JavaScript variables. If you need a reminder of where the data came from, it was through the <strong>Express</strong> router from earlier:
            </p>
            <pre class="theme-atom-one-dark"><code class="hljs-code language-javascript">
                db.query(sqlGameUsers, [gameId], (err, result) => {
                    if (err) console.log(err);
        
                    const gameUsers = result.rows
        
                    res.render('show', { game: game, gameUsers: gameUsers })
                })
            </code></pre>
            <span class="subtitle">'show' is the name of the games template and 'game' and 'gameUsers' are the data retrieved from the database via the query(s).</span>
            <p>
                With <strong>Express</strong> and <strong>EJS</strong> together, I could do all my CRUD functions:
                <ul>
                    <li>C(reating) was fulfilled through forms that allowed users to sign up and create an account. Additionally, users can also create entries in the database by adding new games to their list of games.</li>
                    <li>R(eading) was achieved any time data was displayed on a page.</li>
                    <li>U(pdating) was fulfilled by allowing users to update their remarks for games as well as their general profile information.</li>
                    <li>D(estroying) was fulfilled by allowing users to remove entries from their game lists.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                And that covers most of the important parts of GameShare's code... wait a sec <span class="hacked">I'm dropping out again...</span>

                  -> Hey, it's your local Hackerman again. JF forgot to mention that he created some <em style="color: yellow;">'middlewares'</em>. This is basically extra code that runs before you get to a route.
                  In particular, JF has some middlewares to determine if a user is logged in and whether they are on their own profile to check whether they can edit things.
                  This means I can't just go to a URL like <em style="color: plum;">"users/SomeOtherPersonsID/edit-profile"</em> and vandalize their page because, even if I'm logged in, my user ID won't be the same as the one I'm trying to edit. Blast!
