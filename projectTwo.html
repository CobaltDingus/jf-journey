            <h1>Laying the Foundations</h1>
            <p>
              For this project, we had to make a CRUD app, which stands for
              <strong>CREATE-READ-UPDATE-DESTROY</strong>, referring to the
              actions you can take with a database. In short, this meant making
              a website that gave users the ability to do all four actions to
              the data in a connected database. Being a <em>gamer</em>, I
              decided to make something related to games. After some thinking,
              <strong style="color: green">GameShare&trade;</strong> was brought
              into existence: a website where people could share what games they
              played and find other people who share their interests. Kinda like
              a gaming rip-off of Tinder<sup>&reg;</sup>.
            </p>
            <p>
              With my idea set in stone, I now had to make a database for all
              the information I needed to store. PostgreSQL was the tool that we
              were given for this purpose. Itâ€™s a relational database management
              system, which just means we just stuff all our data into tables
              with columns of attributes and rows and rows of data all following
              the same structure.
            </p>
            <p>For my app, I decided that I needed 3 tables:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>users:</strong> for user information,</li>
              <li><strong>games:</strong> for game information,</li>
              <li>
                and <strong>usergamelist:</strong> for each user's list of games
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h1>Working with Databases</h1>
            <p>
              With the database ready, I now had to seed it with dummy data.
              Using JavaScript, I connected to the database and made a request
              to add new data to it. This is an example of the C(reating) part
              of CRUD, although ironically, it doesn't count for the overall
              objective (explanation later).

                -> The way it works is by first generating
                <em style="color: aquamarine">salt</em>, a string of random
                numbers that will be attached to your password. The
                <em style="color: aquamarine">salted password</em> is then run
                through a hashing algorithm to turn it into an abomination of
                random characters that I will have to spend years trying to
                reverse engineer.

                -> This <em style="color: blue">hashed password</em> is what is
                sent to the database along with the user's name and email. The
                trick then is that a password passed through all the same
                <strong style="color: red">bcrypt</strong> functions will always
                return the same <em style="color: blue">hashed password</em>.
                This is how your plain text password is checked upon logging
                into the website.

              ...alright, I'm back. My service provider said they had to cut me
              off because I didn't pay my bill or something? Anyway, back to
              coding. In the pile of code above, there were 3 steps to
              communicating with PostgreSQL:

              class="theme-atom-one-dark"
            ><code class="hljs-code language-javascript">
                        const db = require('./index.js')
                        
                        const sql = `INSERT INTO users (username, email, password_hashed) VALUES ($1, $2, $3);`

                            if (err) console.log(err);

              1. Connecting to the database. The index file contained all the
              necessary code to import the database as an object to execute
              functions.
            </p>
            <p>
              2. Coming up with instructions. SQL statements are, by design,
              meant to be somewhat understandable to non-coders. This one
              basically says "I want to insert some data in the users table,
              under these three columns, using three specific values for each
              respectively (marked as placeholders for now)."
            </p>
            <p>
              3. Making the actual query. Using the <code>.query</code> method
              on the <code>db</code> variable, the <code>sql</code> statement is
              sent the database, along with all the other info that's meant to
              fill in the placeholders (i.e. the user's name, email, and hashed
              password that was acquired earlier).

            <div>-</div>
            <p>
              I then repeated this process with a loop to seed dummy data for 10
              users to simulate people caring about and using my
              website. With all the backend set up, I was ready to start with the
              actual website.

            <h1>Design ideas</h1>
            <p>
              Given that we were all doing Tic-Tac-Toe, I had to try and put a
              unique spin on my website. For my spin, I decided to try doing a
              â€˜historyâ€™ theme to explore the long history of the game itself.
              Initially, I wanted to have different backgrounds, each
              representing a period of time over the centuries of Tic-Tac-Toeâ€™s
              existence. However, I quickly ran into a problem with this
              approach: the design of my board would conflict with the
              background, being too bright or too dark and just being hard to
              see in general. With most of my time spent on making the game work
              in the first place, I switched gears and tried to do an â€˜arts and
              craftsâ€™ theme. I picked a font that looked handwritten, a
              background colour that looked like brown paper, and simple
              monochromatic colors for the buttons. Luckily, I still kept some
              of my original ideas in the Trivia section which just spews out
              historical trivia about Tic-Tac-Toe.
