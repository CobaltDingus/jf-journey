                    PostgreSQL is a relational database management system. In short, it means we just stuff all our data into a table with columns of attributes and rows and rows of data all following the same structure. The first thing here was to keep track of user login credentials. 
                    
                    
                    The words in white are the column names and the words in blue specify what has to go into each column
                    
                    Now you’re probably thinking “how do you get users when you don’t even have a site yet?”
                    
                    Well it’s simple: we made them up. Using JavaScript, we could connect to our database and use SQL statements to seed some dummy data. 
                    
                    There’s a truckload of things going on here but it’s fairly simple. The handy thing about SQL is that it more or less describes exactly what you’re doing: INSERT data INTO the users table, filling the specified columns (username, email, password_hashed) with the VALUES that you want to put in. 
                    
                    Before actually putting the data in however, we also used bycrypt - a library that uses an algorithm to convert normal passwords into unintelligible garbage (a ‘hashed password’) to make them harder to hack - because, as it turns out, websites don’t store your password as it is. Each time the user logs in thereafter, we simply pass in whatever they type through the hashing process again and let them in if the hash is the same. 
                    
                    With all our necessary user data ready to go, we finally use the .query function of our database to connect to it and pass it our SQL statement to add the user into our database.

                    Obviously, we weren’t just going to make a database that just stores users and nothing else. Being a gamer, I decided to make my website about games. Users would be able to show off a list of their favourite games to compare with other users and hopefully get in contact with people who share their interest. This meant I had to make two tables: one for all the different games and another to show the games for each user.
                    
                    Pretty much the same thing here except for the foreign keys. These are meant to represent the keys of another table, which helps to make sure the data is valid and also helps for joining the tables later when I need all the data in one spot. Like with the users, I also seeded these two tables with dummy data to simulate having people who care about my site enough to use it.

                <h1>Design ideas</h1>
                <p>
                    Given that we were all doing Tic-Tac-Toe, I had to try and put a unique spin on my website. For my spin, I decided to try doing a ‘history’ theme to explore the long history of the game itself. Initially, I wanted to have different backgrounds, each representing a period of time over the centuries of Tic-Tac-Toe’s existence. However, I quickly ran into a problem with this approach: the design of my board would conflict with the background, being too bright or too dark and just being hard to see in general. With most of my time spent on making the game work in the first place, I switched gears and tried to do an ‘arts and crafts’ theme. I picked a font that looked handwritten, a background colour that looked like brown paper, and simple monochromatic colors for the buttons. Luckily, I still kept some of my original ideas in the Trivia section which just spews out historical trivia about Tic-Tac-Toe.
